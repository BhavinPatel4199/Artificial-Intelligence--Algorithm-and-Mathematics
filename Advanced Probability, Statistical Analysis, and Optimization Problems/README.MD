# Statistical Analysis and Optimization Techniques using Python

This repository contains solutions to a series of statistical and mathematical problems, designed to deepen understanding of key concepts in statistics, optimization, and linear algebra.

## 1. Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

### Description:
- **Objective:** Analyze mercury levels in walleye fish to determine if they exceed Health Canadaâ€™s action level of 1 ppm.
- **Tasks:**
  - Formulate and establish statistical hypotheses.
  - Perform hypothesis tests, such as the one-sample t-test.
  - Explain Type I and Type II errors.
  - Make recommendations based on the analysis.
  - Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for mercury levels.

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Statistical libraries such as `scipy` and `numpy`

## 2. Gradient Descent Optimization

### Description:
- **Objective:** Minimize a quadratic function using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
- **Tasks:**
  - Apply the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the optimal values.
  - Report values after each iteration until convergence (or up to 5 iterations if solving manually).

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Mathematical libraries such as `numpy`

## 3. Matrix Properties

### Description:
- **Objective:** Verify matrix properties for a given matrix \(A\) to confirm that \(AI = IA = A\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.
- **Tasks:**
  - Demonstrate and verify fundamental matrix properties.

### Tools Used:
- Python
- `numpy` for matrix operations

## 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
