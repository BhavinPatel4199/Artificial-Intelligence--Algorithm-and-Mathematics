## Statistical Analysis and Optimization Problems

This repository contains solutions to various statistical and mathematical problems, including:

### 1. Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals
Analyzes mercury levels in walleye fish to determine if they exceed Health Canadaâ€™s action level of 1 ppm. Includes:
- Establishing statistical hypotheses
- Performing hypothesis tests (e.g., one-sample t-test)
- Explaining Type I and Type II errors
- Making recommendations based on data
- Calculating and interpreting confidence intervals

### 2. Gradient Descent Optimization
Uses the Gradient Descent algorithm to minimize a quadratic function. Involves:
- Applying Gradient Descent to find optimal values
- Reporting values after each iteration until convergence (or up to 5 iterations if solving manually)

### 3. Matrix Properties
Verifies matrix properties for a given matrix \(A\) to show that \(AI = IA = A\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Finds eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given 2x2 matrix, essential for understanding matrix transformations and linear systems.

This repository provides practical examples and solutions for understanding key concepts in statistics and linear algebra.
