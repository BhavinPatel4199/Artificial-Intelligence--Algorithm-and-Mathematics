This repository contains solutions to various machine learning and data analysis problems, including:

### 1. KNN and Decision Trees
Analyzes customer default status using:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implements the KNN algorithm with K=3 using Manhattan distance to predict the class of a new sample.
- **Decision Tree**: Constructs a decision tree using entropy as a purity measure and predicts the class of a sample based on the created tree.
- **Comparison**: Discusses the resilience of KNN vs. Decision Trees to irrelevant features in datasets.

### 2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Works with a 2D plane to:
- **Create a Linear Decision Boundary**: Uses SVM logic to separate two classes.
- **Identify Slope and Intercept**: Calculates and identifies the slope and intercept of the decision boundary.
- **Declare Support Vectors**: Identifies support vectors used to determine the decision boundary.

### 3. Hierarchical Clustering
Uses complete linkage hierarchical clustering on 2D data points:
- **Clustering Implementation**: Performs hierarchical clustering using Manhattan distance.
- **Dendrogram Construction**: Draws a dendrogram to visualize the clustering process.
- **Outlier Detection**: Discusses the ability of hierarchical clustering to detect outliers.
- **Dendrogram Pruning**: Explains methods to prune the dendrogram.

### Bonus Questions
Explains key concepts in machine learning:
- **Bias-Variance Trade-Off**: Discusses the trade-off between bias and variance, and its relation to overfitting and underfitting.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Defines the confusion matrix, its components, and what information can be derived from it.
- **ROC Curve**: Explains the ROC curve, its use in evaluating model performance, and what can be inferred from it.
- **Regularization**: Describes regularization techniques and provides examples of how they help prevent overfitting.

This repository provides practical examples and detailed solutions to fundamental machine learning techniques and concepts.
