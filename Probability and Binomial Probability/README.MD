# Probability Analysis using Venn Diagrams and Binomial Distribution

This repository contains solutions to problems involving probability concepts, Venn diagrams, and binomial distribution. The focus is on understanding and applying these concepts to real-world scenarios.

## Q1: Probability and Venn Diagrams

### Description:
- **Objective:** Analyze crime statistics using probability and Venn diagrams.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Completing a Probability Table:** Fill in missing values in a table involving categories of male (M) and under 18 (U18) using given probabilities.
  - **Calculating Combined Probabilities:** Determine the probabilities for:
    - Being male or under 18.
    - Neither male nor under 18.
    - Being male and at least 18 years of age.
  - **Determining Mutual Exclusivity:** Evaluate whether the events of being male and under 18 are mutually exclusive.

### Key Concepts:
- Basic probability
- Venn diagrams
- Mutual exclusivity

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Probability libraries or manual calculation methods

## Q2: Binomial Probability

### Description:
- **Objective:** Evaluate voter behavior using binomial probability distribution.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Calculating Exact Probabilities:** Find the probability of exactly 2 out of 5 voters favoring the smoking ban.
  - **Calculating Cumulative Probabilities:** Find the probability of fewer than 4 out of 5 voters favoring the ban.
  - **Calculating Complementary Probabilities:** Find the probability of at least 1 out of 5 voters favoring the ban.

### Key Concepts:
- Binomial probability distribution
- Exact, cumulative, and complementary probabilities

### Tools Used:
- Python
- `scipy.stats` for binomial probability calculations
